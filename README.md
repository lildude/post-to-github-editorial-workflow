# Post to GitHub Editorial Workflow

The Python script that goes with my [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) workflow for posting to my Jekyll blog repos directly on GitHub.

Requires the [RV: GitHub Authorize](http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5843990536519680/HkwxAKo3RS0) workflow to store the GitHub access token.
